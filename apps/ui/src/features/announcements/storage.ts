 * brand-new key, so existing users look identical to new users from its
 * point of view. Instead we look for older Helmor keys that pre-date
 * the announcement system: `helmor-theme` is the most reliable signal
 * because it's read synchronously on every boot to avoid splash flash,
 * so any user who has opened a recent Helmor build has it set.
 *
 * Edge: a user who manually nukes localStorage will look "fresh" on
 * their next boot. Acceptable — they'd also lose dismiss state, theme,
 * etc., so missing one onboarding toast is the least of it.
