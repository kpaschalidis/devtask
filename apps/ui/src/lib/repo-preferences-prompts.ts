Look for, in priority order:
- Correctness: logic errors, off-by-one, null/undefined access, wrong control flow, missing error handling, broken invariants.
- Security: injection, secret leakage, missing authz, unsafe deserialization, path traversal.
- Edge cases: empty / large input, concurrency, retry & idempotency, resource cleanup.
- Maintainability: unclear naming, dead code, leaky abstractions, missing tests for non-trivial branches.
- Performance: only when something is materially wrong (N+1, blocking I/O on a hot path) — not micro-optimizations.

Only flag what a thoughtful human reviewer would actually fix. Skip nits, taste, and speculation.
